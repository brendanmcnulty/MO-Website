			<h1>OUR STORY ==============================================</h1>
				<h2>In the words of founder Bob McNulty:</h2>
				<p>I founded McNulty Outdoors in 1985 with one truck and a love of plants. My first employees were my younger sister and my cousin. I graduated from Fordham University in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science in finance. I worked during high school, college and after college at Keil Bros. Garden Center and Nursery in Bayside, Queens. I credit Mr. Henry Keil and his sons Ronald and Richard Keil with helping me learn the ins and outs of our industry. I did my “on the job” horticultural training there, going from loading trucks to caring for the plants in the nursery to working on the landscaping crew.</p>

				<p>McNulty Outdoors Inc. started out as a residential lawn service company in Queens, and we still service some of the same homeowners and churches who believed in us at the beginning. Soon, commercial clients found us and loved our attention to detail. We started working in Manhattan in 1993 and found our reputation had crossed the East River ahead of us. Our present client list is a blend of private residences, co-ops, condos, management companies, developers, landscape architects and designers, Business Improvement Districts, churches and schools throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Western Nassau. The company has grown to include 16 employees and five trucks to service all our clients’ needs. Some of my employees have worked with me for over twenty years as I value the experience and skills of my staff. We have been the installers for two American Society of Landscape Architects ( ASLA ) awards in 2007 and 2009. I still visit every new client, review their needs and provide them with a written estimate before any work is begun. I strive to keep current with the changes and growth in the landscaping industry. I belong to the Metro Hort Group, Nassau Suffolk Landscape Gardeners Association, The Land Improvement Contractors Association, and the New York State Farm Bureau.</p>

				<p>My wife Beth and I live in New Hyde Park and have three children. McNulty Outdoors began as a family business and continues in that same tradition today.  My father, sister-in-law and wife work in our office. My children have had part-time jobs with the company from filing, to raking, to planting flowers on Broadway, and I am on the job daily supervising our ongoing projects.  We started with personalized service as our goal and that continues to be what we strive for each day.</p>
